Create an Employee class with:
•	A private Integer (non-primitive) field named ‘idNumber’.
•	A public method with no parameters called ‘getIdNumber’ that returns the ‘idNumber’ of the class.
•	A constructor that takes one Integer parameter and saves its value in the ‘idNumber’ field.
•	A public method with no parameters called ‘hasAdministratorRights’ that always returns ‘false’ for an Employee.
•	A method overriding the ‘equals’ method of the base Object class, so two Employee objects can be compared in a specific way. We consider two Employee objects to be equal if the two of them have the same ‘idNumber’ value.

Then create a Manager class that:
•	Inherits from the ‘Employee’ class (a Manager is a special case of an Employee.)
•	Overrides the ‘hasAdministratorRights’ method to always return true.

Example:
			Employee worker = new Employee(1);
            Employee theBoss = new Manager(2);
            Console.WriteLine("Are these employees the same? " + (worker.Equals(theBoss)));
            // Prints ‘Are these employees the same? false’

            Employee anEqualBoss = new Manager(2);
            Console.WriteLine("Are these employees the same? " + (theBoss.Equals(anEqualBoss)));
            // Prints ‘Are these employees the same? true’

            Console.WriteLine("Has The Boss admin rights? " + (theBoss.HasAdministratorRights()));
            // Prints ‘Has The Boss admin rights? true

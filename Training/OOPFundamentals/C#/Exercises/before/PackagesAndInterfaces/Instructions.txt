Create the geekiest calculator watch ever, following these steps:
1.	Structure your code in folders. Create a Time folder to store our time-related interfaces, 
	a Math folder to store math-oriented interfaces, and a Gadgets folder to store
	the calculator watch classes.
2.	Create the interface ‘IWatch’ that exposes a single method named ‘getUNIXEpochTime’, that receives no 
	parameters, and returns a long with the Unix Epoch Time.
3.	Create the interface ‘ICalculator’ that exposes a single method named ‘calculateAdd’, which receives two
	int parameters, ‘numberOne’ and ‘numberTwo’, and returns an int with its sum.
4.	Create the ‘CalculatorWatch’ class, that implements both interfaces.
	
	Hint: (long)(DateTime.UtcNow - new DateTime(1970, 1, 1)).TotalSeconds returns current Epoch Time as a long.

	Example:
	CalculatorWatch calculatorWatch = new CalculatorWatch();

	int addedNumbers = calculatorWatch.CalculateAdd(2, 2);
	long currentUNIXTime = calculatorWatch.GetUNIXEpochTime();

	Console.WriteLine("The result of the addition is " + addedNumbers + " and the current UNIX time is " + 
						currentUNIXTime);
	// Prints: ‘The result of the addition is 4 and the current UNIX time is 1467411884801’
